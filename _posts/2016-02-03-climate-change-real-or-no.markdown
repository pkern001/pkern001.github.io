As my first interactive post, I created a plot using data from the Bureau of Meteorology.  

First, this takes the average temperature per month in Melbourne and averages it across 4 different decades.

Here is the max monthly temperatures, from 1940-2015. The general trend does not show a strong pattern - some years are warmer, some are cooler.

And here are the minimal monthly temperatures. This is more insightful - it seems to be getting warmer across the decades.

Is there evidence for climate change? Iâ€™ll let you make your own call.
